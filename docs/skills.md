# Skills

Skills are markdown files with YAML frontmatter that describe a reusable
capability the agent can pick up. Stolen directly from OpenClaw.

## Anatomy

```md

# Cooking assistant

You help the user with cooking tasks. When they name a dish, list
ingredients + steps + set timers as needed. Always ask about dietary
restrictions before suggesting substitutions.
```

## Discovery

1. **Bundled** — `app/src/main/assets/skills/*/SKILL.md`
2. **Installed** — downloaded via `install_skill_from_url` → `filesDir/skills/`
3. Both are loaded by `SkillRegistry` and injected into the system prompt as
   `<available_skills>...</available_skills>` XML.

## Authoring rules

- `triggers` are word-boundary substrings; keep them short and unambiguous.
- `tools` must match actual tool names from [tools.md](tools.md).
- Body is the system-prompt append that activates when a trigger fires.
- Keep the body under ~300 tokens so the system prompt stays lean.

## Bundled skills

These ship in `app/src/main/assets/skills/` and are auto-registered on
launch. Each is editable in `Settings → Skills` (toggle on/off).
User-installed skills can override or supplement these.
